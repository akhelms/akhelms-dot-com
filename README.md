# akhelms.github.io

This is the git repository for my personal website/online headquarters: www.akhelms.com.  

If you notice any issues with the site/code or if you have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request and I'll take a look.  

Feel free to steal anything you find here, as long as you don't pretend to be me somewhere else. In other words: the code is up for grabs, but use your own words when you implement it.
